## Game Rules:


## Deliverables and other Requirements:

* Have some fun!
* In your own fork, please replace this README.md file's contents with a good introduction to your own project. 
* Targeted Algorithm Analysis:  Regardless of which option you choose, you need to _describe the performance characteristics of some critical parts of your program and explain why you chose the data structures and core algorithm(s) you did_. Examples, if you chose Type #1, what's the Big-O, Big-Theta, or Big-Omega run-time complexity of your puzzle solver? Or the puzzle generator? If you're doing Type #2 and using minimax or negamax, what's the complexity of your _heuristic evaluation function_? ...and of the function that finds all legal moves from a game state? 
* Performance Measurement: Supplement the analysis above with run-time measurements of multiple iterations of the game or puzzles as discussed in class. Sample results from a run-time profiler is a good idea at least as part of the measurements.
* If your team has more than one student, see that everyone makes substantial git commits. In addition, your README documentation should include a summary of how you shared the work.
* Live in-class presentation & demonstration of your work.
